# quantum-rendering-unity
## Support
I have confirmed that it works in the following environment:
- Unity 2022.3.11f1, Python 3.11.6, and macOS Sequoia (v15.0 Beta)
- Unity 2022.3.11f1, Python 3.12.0, and Windows11 (23H2)

## Requirements
- Unity
- Python & Related modules (They are described in requirements.txt.)

## How to use
(1) Open the Main scene in "Assets > QuantumRendering > Scenes".

![01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea811b8e-d239-49ac-aae3-9a997465a7e4)

(2) Open server window from "Window > MU5 > Server".

(3) Set your python path and server application path.

(4) Click start button to start server.

Then, you can see server console window.

It will work by default settings.

(5) Play the scene in Unity.

Then, you can see the quantum rendering in the Scene window (NOT the Game window).

(6) Moreover, you can set the strength of quantum blur, which is measured in radians.
